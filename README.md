# **Layoff Data Analysis & Prediction**  

### **Overview**  
This project analyzes **layoff trends from 2020-2023**, providing insights into layoffs over time, industry-specific trends, and monthly patterns. It also includes a predictive model to forecast layoffs.  

### **Features**  
- âœ… Loads and cleans layoff data  
- âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- âœ… Industry-wise and time-based layoff trends  
- âœ… Monthly layoff analysis  
- âœ… Predictive modeling using Machine Learning  


### **Installation & Setup**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/layoff-analysis.git
   cd layoff-analysis

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn


3. Run the analysis:
   ```bash
   python main.py

### **Functions & Workflow**  

- **Data Collection:**  
  Loads the `layoffs_data.csv` file containing historical layoffs data.

- **Data Cleaning:**  
  Cleans the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting columns for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - **Layoffs over time:** Visualizes the trend of layoffs over the years.  
  - **Layoffs by industry:** Shows how layoffs are distributed across different industries.

- **Detailed Analysis:**  
  Provides insights on **monthly layoffs trends**, helping to identify patterns and anomalies.

- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  Trains a machine learning model using historical layoff data and predicts potential future layoffs.


### **Future Enhancements**
Deploy as an interactive dashboard
Use deep learning for better predictions
Integrate real-time layoff data sources
